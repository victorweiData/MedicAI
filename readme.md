## 4. Model Training  

### Architecture  
- ResNet-18 backbone (transfer learning)  
- Output: Binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal)  
- Framework: PyTorch  

### Training Approaches  

#### A. SageMaker Training (Initial Approach)
- GPU: `ml.g4dn.xlarge`  
- Accuracy: 85%  
- Cost: $20–$40  
- Data Augmentation: crop, color, cutout  
- Optimizer: Adam  

#### B. Local PyTorch Training (Final Solution)
The decision to train locally using PyTorch was driven by both cost considerations and the need for more granular control over the training process. This approach required significant technical expertise and careful environment management.

- **Accuracy: 96%** (11% improvement over SageMaker)
- **Training time: 2 hours**  
- **Cost: $0** (100% cost reduction)

## 5. Technical Challenges & Difficulties

### Major Challenges Encountered

#### Local PyTorch Training Complexity
Training the model locally presented several significant technical hurdles:

**Memory Management & Optimization**
- Handling large image datasets that exceeded available RAM
- Implementing efficient data loading with PyTorch DataLoader
- Managing GPU memory allocation to prevent out-of-memory errors
- Optimizing batch sizes for maximum GPU utilization without crashes

**Custom Training Pipeline Development**
- Building a robust training loop from scratch with proper error handling

**Model Serialization & AWS Compatibility**
- Converting trained PyTorch models to the specific format required by SageMaker
- Creating proper inference scripts that work within AWS Lambda constraints
- Ensuring model artifacts are properly packaged for S3 storage

#### Cloud Integration Challenges

**AWS Service Orchestration**
- Configuring complex IAM permissions across multiple AWS services
- Managing VPC networking and security groups for SageMaker endpoints
- Debugging Lambda function timeout and memory issues
- Handling API Gateway integration with proper error responses

The most significant challenge was achieving the 96% accuracy through local PyTorch training while maintaining compatibility with AWS deployment requirements. This required deep understanding of both PyTorch internals and AWS service limitations, ultimately resulting in a superior solution that was both more accurate and cost-effective.

## 6. Deployment Pipeline  

### Model Packaging for AWS
Converting the locally trained PyTorch model for AWS deployment required careful attention to format compatibility:

```bash
# Package trained PyTorch model in SageMaker-compatible format
tar czf model.tar.gz model.pth code/inference.py requirements.txt
aws s3 cp model.tar.gz s3://victor-medical-ai-chest-xray/models/resnet18-local/
```

### SageMaker Endpoint  
- Name: `Demo-image-classifier-pneumonia`  
- Instance: `ml.m5.xlarge`  
- Auto-scaling: Enabled  
- Secured: VPC + IAM  

### Lambda Inference  
- Receives base64 image → invokes SageMaker → returns class & confidence  
- Average latency: < 1s

## 7. Web Application  

### Frontend (React)  
- Drag & drop file upload  
- Real-time predictions with visual feedback  

### Backend (Express.js)

  patientName: "Jane Doe",
  prediction: "Pneumonia",
  confidence: 0.972,
  timestamp: "2025-06-22T01:03:12Z"
}
```
